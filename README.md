This is a simple example of creating a prefetch-menu using Freebase. This is an implementation of autosuggest pop-up menus using Mjt and jQuery. Menus are Mjt templates that use a particular microformat. The controller is almost completely isolated from the query used to populate the menu, though the related data suggestion example uses a Freebase query.
